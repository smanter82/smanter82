### Sarah Manter - Full-stack Web Developer

## Currently working on:

I just finished building the second stage of a Gym Logistical Tracker with an amazing group of colleagues. I'm now working on a Google Books search app and an application that will allow users to search their government reps by town and see their recent votes on education related issues.

## Currently learning:
I am just completed the UNH Coding Bootcamp.  We most recently learned to work with React.  I am looking forward to reviewing what we learned in the course to become more automatic with the basics.
