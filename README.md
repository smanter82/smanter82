### Sarah Manter - Full-stack Web Developer

## Currently working on:

I just finished building the second stage of a Gym Logistical Tracker with an amazing group of colleagues. I'm now working on a family website that will allow my two children and me to post our individual talents.  For example, my son can post his comics, and my daughter can post her artwork.  I am also looking into creating an application that will allow parents to track cold/illness symptoms at the request of a mom friend.

## Currently learning:
I am just completed the UNH Coding Bootcamp.  We most recently learned to work with React. I have been reviewing what I learned in the course, as well as working my way through courses in AWS, CI/CD, and Typescript.  I'm also working my way through Freecodecamp.org from the beginning to pick up skills that I've missed along the way.
